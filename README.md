# Project-WheaterAPI

Indonesia, with its diverse climates and unique geographical conditions, always fascinated me in how weather patterns affect daily life—from agriculture, transportation, to even how we plan our weekends. That curiosity drove me to experiment with real weather data and transform it into something insightful and visually engaging.

##🔹 Objective

Integrate real-time and historical weather data to provide a comprehensive overview of climate conditions in several Indonesian cities.

Create an interactive and easy-to-understand dashboard that can be used as a decision support tool for daily planning, agriculture, and transportation.

Cultivate data storytelling skills with a focus on effective visualization.

##📊 Key Features & KPIs

Forecast Monitoring → displays daily temperature projections (accuracy is measured by deviation from actual data).

Air Quality Index (AQI) → air quality categories (Moderate, Good, Unhealthy) with indicators of PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, O₃.

Sunrise & Sunset Time → consistent astronomical time indicators.

Chance of Rain → probability of rainfall per day (KPI: prediction rate >80% accurate).

Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed, Visibility → detailed weather parameters whose trends can be monitored.

##🔧 How I built it:

Pulled live and historical data from WeatherAPI

Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis

Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to showcase temperature, humidity, and rainfall trends across multiple regions

Focused on making the visuals not just informative, but also easy to interpret at a glance

##📊 What I learned along the way:

How to effectively integrate external APIs into a data pipeline

The importance of data storytelling—turning raw numbers into clear insights

Best practices in dashboard design so users can quickly grasp what matters most

That even a “simple” dataset like weather can reveal fascinating patterns when visualized properly

##💡 This project reminded me that data visualization is more than charts—it’s about helping people make sense of complexity. Whether it’s a business decision or simply understanding tomorrow’s forecast, the way we present data can empower better actions.
